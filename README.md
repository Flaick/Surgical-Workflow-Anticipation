# Surgical-Workflow-Anticipation
Surgical Instrument &amp; Phase Anticipation      
Paper entitled <Surgical Workflow Anticipation usingInstrument Interaction> is accepted by MICCAI 2021 conference!
## Goal
Here we study the anticipation problem in surgical workflow for endoscopic surgery. This method opts for the real-time regression format, predicting the remaining time until the occurrence of next instrument &amp; phase. The demo output is here:
