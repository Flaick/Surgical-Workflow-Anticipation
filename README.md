# Surgical Workflow Anticipation
Surgical Instrument &amp; Phase Anticipation      
Paper entitled \<Surgical Workflow Anticipation usingInstrument Interaction\> is accepted by MICCAI 2021 conference!

## Goal
Here we study the anticipation problem in surgical workflow for endoscopic surgery. This method opts for the real-time regression format, predicting the remaining time until the occurrence of next instrument &amp; phase. 

## Network Architecture

2D + 1D structure (ResNet + MS-TCN)
