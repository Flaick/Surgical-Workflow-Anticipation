# Surgical-Workflow-Anticipation
Surgical Instrument &amp; Phase Anticipation
## Goal
Here we study the anticipation problem in surgical workflow for endoscopic surgery. This method opts for the real-time regression format, predicting the remaining time until the occurrence of next instrument &amp; phase. The demo output is here:
